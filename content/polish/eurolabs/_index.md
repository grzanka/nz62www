#### What is Euro - Labs?
EURO-LABS is a network of 33 research and academic institutions from 18 countries (25 beneficiaries and 8 associated partners) from European and non-EU countries, involving 47 Research Infrastructures in the Nuclear physics, Accelerators and Detectors pillars. Within this large network, EURO-LABS will ensure diversity and actively support researchers from different nationalities, gender, age, grade, and variety of professional expertise. **EURO-LABS supports Transnational Access (TA) to various facilities having energetic beams (protons, mesons, muons, electrons) and irradiation facilities in mixed hadron and g fields.**

#### Who can apply for EURO-LABS TA?
Support via Transnational Access will be granted to user groups, where the team leader and the majority of the members are working at an institution which is outside POLAND

## **Application for EURO-LABS TA**

 1. **Contact the facility coordinator** for the facility you are interested in with brief details of your proposal. This step will ensure that your experiment is doable and that you are eligible for TA support before you go through the formal application procedure.
 
2. **Fill out the AIC-144 APPLICATION FORM** including proposals describing the work that you wish to carry out at IFJ PAN AIC-144 Cyclotron Facility (according to the instructions in there) and submit it. Proposals can be submitted any time during the current support period.

3.  The experiment **proposal will be evaluated** by the facility advisory/supervisory committee. You will be informed about the recommendations and about the beam time scheduling of your experiment, if accepted.

4. The User group leader (spokesperson of the experiment) should **fill**:
- the application form (Word, PDF) for transnational access;		
- the information request form with the information of the people in the research group;
 
5. The selection of user groups and experiments is primarily the responsibility of the facility coordinator, acting with approval of the User Selection Panel. **You will be informed** whether and to which extent your request was approved.

6. Reimbursement is handled by each facility, in line with **facility rules**. Users should complete a confirmation of transnational access form, as well as a facility-specific reimbursement form and return them to the facility coordinator. Details of reimbursement can be found on the information page for each facility.

7. Publications are required to acknowledge the EURO-LABS project: This project has received funding from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon Europe Research and Innovation programme under Grant Agreement No 101057511 (EURO-LABS). **User groups also need to notify us of any publication of any results related to their EURO-LABS Transnational Access.**
