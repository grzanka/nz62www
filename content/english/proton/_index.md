Our proton beam, generated by AIC-144 (Asynchronous Isochronic Cyclotron), can be accessed in one of the two rooms:

 - former eye treatment hall
 - experimental hall

|parameter| eye hall|experimental hall| 
|--|--|--
| max. energy [MeV] | 58 |60
|current [nA]| | 2-100
|flux [p/cm<sup>2</sup>/s]|min. 5e5,typical e8||
|diameter [mm]|40|40|
|dose rate in H<sub>2</sub>O [Gy/s] | 0.001 - 1||
|max. dose|1 kGy||
|field homogeneity|≥ 5% ||


### Time structure

The beam is supplied in macropulses with 50 Hz frequency and pulse duration 0.5 ms. Each macropulse is divided into micropulses with 26.26 MHz frequency and 38.08 ns pulse duration.

### Proton energy spectrum modification
In the eye hall, proton energy can be reduced in the range from ... to ... MeV by addition of a discriminator (range shifter). To get a broader energy spectrum (spread-out Bragg peak), a modulator can be used.
### Beam scattering
The beam can be scattered by our different metal (lead, tungsten) foils.
