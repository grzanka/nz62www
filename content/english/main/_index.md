### *WELCOME*
Welcome to the main page of **pIFJ**. We operate as part of the Krakow Institute of Nuclear Physics.  


The Krakow **pIFJ** is a **PROTON IRRADIATION FACILITY at IFJ**. We can perform irradiations with an energy of protons up to 60 MeV (high LET). We have a wide range of beam intensity and various techniques of active and passive dosimetry. Parameters such as dose rate or proton beam flux are monitored on an ongoing basis during the experiment and recorded.  

Our infrastructure allows us to irradiate various types of samples:  
- biological (containing living cells),  - chemical - such as nanoparticles,  
- physical - testing the radiation hardness of materials or new detectors,  
- various types of electronics 
- including for the needs of the space industry.  

We invite our guests and clients to cooperate.


The Department of Radiation Research and Proton Radiotherapy is engaged in the design and application of beams of protons and heavier ions in cancer radiotherapy, experimental radiobiology and radiation damage of solid-state systems.

We develop radiobiological models and systems of ion beam transport in order to design radiobiological experiments and to interpret their results. Proton and ion beam radiotherapy planning systems are also under development, applying our models of beam transport and our radiobiology-based models of cancer radiotherapy.

We study experimentally the radiation damage to electronic systems and solid state samples exposed to energetic proton beams.

We study and develop the dosimetry of novel radiotherapy modalities, such as active, spatially fractionated proton beam radiotherapy. In our experiments we use a variety of detectors and individual phantoms, some of which are prepared by 3-D printing technology.
