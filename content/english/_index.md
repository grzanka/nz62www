The Department of Radiation Research and Proton Radiotherapy is engaged in the design and application of beams of protons and heavier ions in cancer radiotherapy, experimental radiobiology and radiation damage of solid-state systems.

We develop radiobiological models and systems of ion beam transport in order to design radiobiological experiments and to interpret their results. Proton and ion beam radiotherapy planning systems are also under development, applying our models of beam transport and our radiobiology-based models of cancer radiotherapy.

We study experimentally the radiation damage of electronic systems and solid state samples exposed to energetic proton beams.

We study and develop the dosimetry of novel radiotherapy modalities, such as active, spatially fractionated proton beam radiotherapy. In our experiments we use a variety of detectors and individual phantoms, some of which are prepared by 3-D printing technology.
